 Princess Leonor of Spain will be taking to the skies in her final year of military training! Queen Letizia and King Felipe's 19-year-old daughter arrived at the General Air and Space Academy in San Javier on Sept. 1 to begin her aeronautical training. "Today I begin the third stage of my military training at this General Air and Space Academy. I look forward with enthusiasm to this course, during which I will have the opportunity to begin my aeronautical training and, alongside my classmates, learn the practical and theoretical aspects of military aviation," Leonor wrote in the Academy's Book of Honor. On her first day, the Princess of Asturias, dressed in her flight uniform, toured the personal flight equipment room, as well as the virtual training classroom, the flight trainer and the flight simulator. The teen even climbed into the cockpit of a PC-21 Pilatus training aircraft. Prior to boarding the aircraft, Leonor was asked by the media how she was approaching this stage, to which she replied "little by little, eager to learn."　Per HOLA! Spain, the future Queen will first take lessons on the ground before flying the aircraft. El País reported on Aug. 31 that Leonor "was qualified as fit to fly before the summer. That is, she meets the altitude and vision requirements" and "is scheduled to begin flying with an instructor within a month." 西班牙王儲、長公主蕾奧諾將在軍事訓練的最後一年翱翔天際。王后雷蒂西亞與國王菲利佩之女、年僅19歲的蕾奧諾公主，9月1日抵達位於聖哈維爾的空軍暨太空總學院，正式展開航空訓練。 公主在學院的《榮譽簿》親筆寫下：「今天，我在空軍暨太空總學院開啟第3階段的軍事訓練。我懷著熱情投入這門課程，將有機會展開航空訓練，並與同學們一同研習軍用航空的理論與實務。」 在首日訓練中，身著飛行服的公主參觀了個人飛行裝備室、虛擬訓練教室、飛行訓練設施與模擬機，並登上PC-21教練機駕駛艙。當媒體詢問公主如何應對此階段訓練時，她說：「循序漸進，求知若渴。」 據西班牙媒體《HOLA！》報導，蕾奧諾公主將先接受地面訓練課程，再進入飛行階段。《國家報》8月31日報導，蕾奧諾「在夏季前已獲得飛行適任資格，符合高度與視力要求，並預計1個月內在教官陪同下展開飛行。」瀏覽器建議使用 Chrome, Firefox, Safari, EdgeCopyright © 2022 中華民國國防部青年日報社 Youth Daily News
